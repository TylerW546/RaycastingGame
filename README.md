# RaycastingGame
A 2.5D Game that uses raycasting to create the illusion of a 3D space. Enemies, weapons, and a UI are included. This was a final project for Intro to Python class in 2019. Code has been left largely as how it was coded in 2019, to keep it as a sort of time capsule. Unfortunately, this means the organization is very lacking.

## Requirements
pygame (python library)
